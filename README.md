# dynv6-updater-scripts
Some scripts I made to update dynv6 servers with my ip's and subdomains

- Checker.sh checks if the subdomain A record has gon missing from dynv6 and fixes it. Used to fix cloud. / nextcloud. subdomains.

My own log for that is also provided to show how stupid can this system sometimes be.
